barebones
=========

A level editor capable of saving a graph to a pickle file which a programmer can easily rebuild in their custom format. It has the ability of undo/redo. No longer is there a need to procedurally position a Node through trial and error. Currently only positioning, rotating, and scaling Models and Actors on the render graph are supported. It's purely Panda with no other libraries used, except Python's of course.

Here's a demo of my widget plus undo/redo:
