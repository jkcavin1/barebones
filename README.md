barebones
=========

A level editor capable of saving a graph to a pickle file which a programmer can easily rebuild as a custom format. It has the ability to undo/redo. Currently only positioning Models and Actors is supported. In the future, this will become a level-wide Pview (Panda's program for previewing Models and Actors) with the capability to adjust color, transparency, and more in pursuit of WYSIWYG level editing using files and code you are already familiar with. It's purely Panda with no other libraries used, except Python's own library.
